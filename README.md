# GFET Fabrication & Characterization Project

This project documents the fabrication and electrical characterization of a Graphene Field-Effect Transistor (GFET). Emphasis is placed on clear data handling, analysis reproducibility, and visualization workflows that reflect good engineering practices. The project combines Excel-based manual charting with Python scripting for automation and repeatability.

The device was fabricated using:

* **Photolithography** for pattern definition
* **E-beam PVD** for metal deposition
* **Bubbling transfer** of CVD-grown graphene onto SiOâ‚‚/Si substrates

---

## ðŸ“Š Objective

To characterize the transfer curve (Drain Current vs. Gate Voltage) of a fabricated GFET and present the results using both manual and automated analysis methods.

## ðŸ“Š Excel + Python Visualization

### Excel Workflow

* Drain current was converted from amperes to microamperes
* Plotted in Excel with labeled axes and fine-tuned formatting

### Python Workflow

* Script in `Analysis/plot_iv_characteristics.py`
* Reads data and plots transfer characteristics with Matplotlib

```bash
cd Analysis
python plot_iv_characteristics.py
```
